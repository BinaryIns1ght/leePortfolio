                    Frutiger Aero
                </a>
                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    I chose this aesthetic as I enjoy this nostalgic style,
                    with the bubbly, optimistic visual design alongside a 
                    color scheme mostly focused on cool colors.

                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    The vibes and tones of vaporwave are awfully nostalgic
                    and calming in a way. Despite the strange style to it,
                    it also feels quite calming to it.

                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    Alongside with Frutiger Aero, Frutiger Aurora has a 
                    beautiful design to it. With the inspiration with the 
                    Aurora Borealis, this aesthetic utilizes beautiful 
                    gradients using mostly warm colors, with a different
                    colored background, usually with cooler colors.

                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    Despite being a scaredycat in real life, I do enjoy a 
                    bit of horror. This includes this aesthetic, where it
                    shows the uncanniness of places, instead of living beings
                    instead.

                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    Another neat horror-themed aesthetic, analog horror has
                    been a recent classic when it comes to horror styled
                    content. There has been many creators that use the style 
                    to design a story with such rivoting and terrifying premise.

                Dr. Pepper
                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    Introducted to it by my mother, this drink 
                    has a sense of twist in taste. Many have 
                    described the taste being like that of medicine, 
                    but I don't see it as that. Instead, it has a 
                    small distinct flavor cherry in it.

                Sparkling Ice, or Sparkling Water
                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    Despite many people thinking Sparkling Water is
                    expensive, my family loves these cheaper sparkling
                    water, named "Sparkling Ice". This drink is basically
                    if you flavor water for a bit, when later carbonate it
                    into a soft drink-like state, you get 
                    <strong style="color: red;">Sparkling Ice</strong>.

                Tea
                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    It always been a long standing argument on whether people
                    enjoy tea. For me, I do enjoy tea, both in their soothing
                    tone along with the benefit of cleansing my body.

                Juices From Fruits, like apple or orange juice
                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    Simple really. I enjoy Fruit Juices as they can vary in 
                    flavor, depending on the manufacturing company or the 
                    types of fruits and/or ingredients they use in the drinks.

                Water
                <p style="margin-right: 10%;">
                    A simple drink, a simple decision. Water is alwats 
                    refreshing to me, especially when cold. If you feel 
                    you want to drink something simple, to hydrate and 
                    refresh yourself for something, some water can help.

                This photo was taken back in: 
                <em>July 23, 2017</em>, back when I was a 
                teen at high school. I always have enjoyed 
                natural landmarks, so this photo is quite
                cool to me.

                taken back in: <em>September 14, 2024</em>. It was
                crazy to see this the first time. I've always wanted
                to take a photo of me over the clouds, with the sun 
                above, so this feels so breathtaking to me.

                This photo was taken place back in <em>August 21, 2017</em>,
                where the "Great American Eclipse" have occured. Due to the 
                bright nature of the sun, the photo was taken with the 
                "eclipse glasses" for better viewing of the eclipse. Though 
                not a complete eclipse on the photo, you do see the sun in
                a cresent shape, instead of the usual circular shape.
                Clicking on the image can lead you to the Wikipedia article 
                about the 2017 Solar Eclipse. I'm using this photo as Solar
                Eclipses are usually a "once in a lifetime" event, so...
