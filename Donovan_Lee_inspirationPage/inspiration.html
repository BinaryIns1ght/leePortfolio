            help coin the term, <strong>"Glassmorphism"</strong>, 
            an aesthetic similar to <em>Frutiger Aero</em>. The

        <h3>
            "Qauz"
        </h3>
        <p>
            A digital artist well-known for their works having a focus
            on outer space. Despite my <abbr title="Fear Of The Daek">
            nyctophobia</abbr>, I always have enjoyed the beauty of space. Quaz's
            works help replicate the beauty of space, despite the scenes
            being fictional.
            <br>
            Fun fact: I enjoyed the first image so much,
