            <h4>
                Hello Everyone!!! &#x1F600;
            </h4>
            <p>
                My name is Donovan Lee. Welcome to my website,
                where you can find a lot of stuff all about me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently a 
                <abbr title="Visual Communication">Vis. Com.</abbr>
                Design major. I am currently a 22-year-old Korean-American 
                man. I currently lived in the outskirts of the Bay Area 
                (recently moved). If you are wondering, my pronouns 
                are he/him/his. I am still getting used to the idea of 
                designing digitally and will probably need more 
                practicing and  studying to further improve my skills 
                in designing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am often described as optimistic and patient by
                many people. Some hobbies I enjoy are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Playing Video Games (Mostly Online and Nintendo Games)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Doing a Bit of Origami
                </li>
                <li>
                    Watching Humorous, or Intriguing, Videos
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
